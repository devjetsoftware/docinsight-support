# Welcome to DocInsight

DocInsight is an API documentation tool designed specifically for Delphi developers. It integrates seamlessly with the Delphi/RAD Studio IDE and features a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, making it easier to document your code directly within the IDE. DocInsight can generate documentation in multiple formats, including HTML and CHM. Additionally, the DocInsight Command-Line Interface (CLI) supports automating the documentation process as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

## Licensing

With the release of DocInsight 2024, we are pleased to introduce a revamped licensing model:

### Commercial license

Licenses are purchased by the company and can be assigned to any single developer within the organization.

### Personal license

Tailored for individual use, this license is intended for those who purchase it with their own funds and should not be financed by companies in any form.
